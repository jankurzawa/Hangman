I decided to apply to Motorola Solutions because programming is 
my passion and I would like to develop it in such a prestigious company. 
I started to be interested in programming already in technical high school. 
I have been learning by myself for some time, using books and the internet, 
and I enjoy creating programs more and more. My friends who worked at Motorola Solutions
always spoke in superlatives about this company, great cooperation with employees and 
managers, and very interesting projects. A positive atmosphere in the company is just as 
important to me as work, because it motivates me to act and expand my qualifications.
